# Numerical Programming with Python 

Python has a collection of libraries which gives users multiple ways to solve a given problem. The symbolic method uses symbolic manipulation with software to get an analytical answer and the numerical method uses approximate methods to estimate the solution without producing an analytical answer. In this interactive book you are introduced to examples which show the appropriate functions and libraries to use for each method.

## Interacting with JupyterHub for class

* UCLA participants (multi-factor authentication required):

  * <a href="https://jupyter.idre.ucla.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbenjum%2Fnumerical-python-part1&urlpath=tree%2Fnumerical-python-part1%2F&branch=main">Launch into JupyterHub</a> (choose UCLA)

* Non UCLA participants (or anyone who has trouble with the above):
  * [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/benjum/numerical-python-part1/HEAD) 

* Note: the best way to learn is to practice, therefore we recommend executing the cells to familiarize yourself with this new language and information
