# # Numerical Programming with Python, Part 1:  Python Basics

# ![image.png](attachment:image.png)

# Python was developed by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991.
# 
# Its core philosophy includes aphorisms like:
# * Beautiful is better than ugly.
# * Explicit is better than implicit.
# * Simple is better than complex.
# * Complex is better than complicated.
# * Readability counts.
# 

# "Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics."
# 
# * Interpreted -- you don't have to compile Python code in order to run it.
# * The simplicity and readability can increase productivity
# * It can be very easy to learn, but it's also a powerful language with many libraries that enhance its ability to efficiently tackle a wide range of computational problems.

# Another interesting tidbit -- "Python" comes from Monty Python's Flying Circus, rather than the snake.

# ## Various ways to run Python code

# * Interactively at a prompt
# * With a file that contains the code you want
# * Inside of an interactive development environment

# Let's switch over to the terminal for awhile to explore....

# ## Calculating

# Simple example: compound interest calculator with annual contributions
# 
# * p = principal
# * r = annual interest rate in percent
# * y = year of the balance
# * c = annual contribution (made at the start of the year)
# 
# $$\text{Balance}(y) = p(1 + r)^y + c\left[\frac{(1 + r)^{y+1} - (1 + r)}{r} \right]$$

# In[1]:


y1 = 1
p1 = 1000
r1 = 0.05
c1 = 100
p1*(1 + r1)**y1 + c1*( ((1 + r1)**(y1 + 1) - (1 + r1)) / r1 )


# In[2]:


y2 = 45
p2 = 1
r2 = 0.05
c2 = 6500
p2*(1 + r2)**y2 + c2*( ((1 + r2)**(y2 + 1) - (1 + r2)) / r2 )


# ## Strings

# In[3]:


parrotreturn = "This parrot is no more! It has ceased to be!"


# In[4]:


parrotreturn[1]


# In[5]:


parrotreturn[0]


# Do note:  Python numbering starts at 0, not 1

# In[6]:


parrotreturn[0:3]


# In[7]:


parrotreturn[0:4]


# Slicing includes the first number but not the last

# In[8]:


parrotreturn.index('!')


# What exactly is ".index"? -- index is a *method* and the "." notifies Python to call the method associated with parrotreturn.

# In[9]:


# Use parrotreturn.index('!') and slicing to print out only the first sentence of the string


# In[10]:


print(parrotreturn)


# In[11]:


parrotreturn = '"This parrot is no more! It has ceased to be!"'


# In[12]:


print(parrotreturn)


# In[13]:


parrotreturn = "\"This parrot is no more! It has ceased to be!\""


# In[14]:


print(parrotreturn)


# In[15]:


parrotreturn = "\"This parrot is no more!\"\n\"It has ceased to be!\""


# In[16]:


print(parrotreturn)


# Strings can also be concatenated and expanded with math operators

# In[17]:


"spam"


# In[18]:


"spam"*3


# In[19]:


'spam'*3 + ' and ham and eggs'


# In[20]:


return3 = "It's expired and gone to meet its maker!"


# In[21]:


parrotreturn + return3


# In[22]:


print(parrotreturn + return3)


# In[23]:


# clean up the quote so that the formatting is consistent


# In[24]:


# put the entire string into one variable
# and use the bracket syntax with slicing to print only the middle sentence

# Back to our simple example of a compound interest calculator with annual contributions

# $$\text{Balance}(y) = p(1 + r)^y + c\left[\frac{(1 + r)^{y+1} - (1 + r)}{r} \right]$$

# Ideally we'd like to plug in a bunch of numbers and see what comes out.
# 
# Functions allow you to collect together a block of code, name it, and run it when called.
# 
# You can pass data into functions and you can get results returned from functions.

# To follow up on this after class, you may find it interesting to check out the documentation for Python.
# * The answers on that stackoverflow page have a link for PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal) and thereby to https://www.python.org/
# * The page also has another link for the official documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/)
# * You may not immediately appreciate all the points on the documentation site, but that is ok.
# * It's intended to be a complete reference, and therefore reading through it is like reading through a dictionary -- not necessarily fun, but comprehensive

# Write your own function definition

# Call your function several times to make sure it works


# ## Modules

# A module is like a library book containing code.  You can write your own module files that include functions you want to save or variables that you want to associate with the code.  
# 
# You can fetch a module using "import", and then all of its variables and functions will be usable inside the local code you are running.  It's therefore very useful for using code that others have already written.
